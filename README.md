## Working process

We build up this project base on Design Thinking process with 5 stages in total: 

### Emphasize: Learn about the audience

We has interviewed and figured out the problem statement of our customer by answer those questions: What they want? When? How can we do it? What are "must-have" things that we want to deliver?, etc.

### Define: Sharpen the key question

We has discussed and sharpen our solution by define our solution outline for customer; out outcome for this state is our website outline that we have reported.

### Ideate: Brainstorm and create solution

For this stage, we have deep thinking to build up detail website outline, its interaction and merge it with our problem statement that we have defined before. For this stage, we have interaction map and basic wireframe for our website.

### Prototype: Build representations of one or more ideas

This stage is really important, we start to build up our solution by coding. First, we follow the wireframe to make sure we have all of the required interaction; then, we merge with below step to enhance our solution.

### Test: Test ideas and gain user feedback

This is also the last step of this model, we do this step and prototype parallelly. We ask our customer for feedback and then fix it along the way. Test and Prototype is happen for around 3 days to have the final result.
