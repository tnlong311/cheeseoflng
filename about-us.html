        Back to us, we are both Vietnamese and suddently inspired by the taste of Jarlsberg cheese, it leads us to a common question that: 
        Why not we bring it to Vietnam to create a chance for our beloved family, friends, Vietnamese can enjoy it with us? From our love 
        for Vietnam and also Norway, we come up with a mission for Cheese of LN is that “Even faraway, everyone can taste from Norway”, 
        and we decided to build up a business model to bring the best quality of Jarlsberg cheese in detail and Norway cusine in general 
        into our beloved Vietnam. We have the key in delivery process to ensure the quality of the product and mainly exchange via online 
        platform.  There are a lot of stories behind this kind of cheese, and not only the food, but we also have an ambitious to deliver 
        to customers our love, our message, our journey via each service, each piece of cheese.
